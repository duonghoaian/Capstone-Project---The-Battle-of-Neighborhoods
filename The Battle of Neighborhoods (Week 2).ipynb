I currently live within walking distance to Melbourne CBD and Flinders station and I enjoy many amenities and venues in the area, such as various international cuisine restaurants, cafes, shopping malls and entertainment. I currently work in a bank within walking distance to my home. However, I have been offered an opportunity to work for a leading consulting firm in Manhattan, NY. They will leverage my BA skills and newly acquired data science to help their business analytics team. I am unsure about taking the role and would like to use this opportunity to dedicate my final coursera project into investigating advantages and disadvatanges of taking this offer.The key question is : How much do I need to spend in comparison to Melbourne to find an apartment with my girl friend which is as convenient and affordable as mine in Melbourne, considering the salary difference. I can use available real estate websites and Google but the idea is to use and apply myself the learned tools during the course. In order to make a comparison and evaluation of the rental options in Manhattan NY, I must set some basis, therefore the apartment in Manhattan must meet the following demands:\n\n- Apartment must be 2 or 3 bedrooms\n\n- Desired location is near a metro station in the Manhattan area and within (1.5 km) radius or less than 30 minutes walking distance\n\n- Price of rent not exceed $7,000 per month\n\n- Top amenities in the selected neighborhood shall be similar to current residence\n\n- Desirable to have venues such as coffee shops, Asian and Japanese/Korean Restaurants, gym and Grocery stores nearby\n\n- As a reference, I have included a map of venues near current residence in Melbourne"

This visual approach and maps with pop-up labels allow quick identification of location, price and feature, thus making the selection very easy.\n\nThe procesing of these DATA and its mapping will allow to answer the key questions to make a decision:\n\nWhat is the cost of available rental places that meet the demands?what is the cost of rent around a mile radius from each subway metro station? what is the area of Manhattan with best rental pricing that meets criteria established?What is the distance from work place (Park Ave and 53 rd St) and the tentative future rental home?
